**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Background

In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)-which involves scoring animals for physical traits-is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data.
With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.

## Description

The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.
Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.
There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.

# Problem 22: Maximizing Section Throughput Using AI-Powered Precise Train Traffic Control

**Problem ID:** 25022

**Organization:** Ministry of Railways

**Department:** Ministry of Railways

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Transportation & Logistics

## Background

Indian Railways manages train movements primarily through the experience of train traffic controllers. While effective, this manual approach faces limitations as network congestion and operational complexity grow. Trains of varying types and priorities must share limited track infrastructure across space and time, making optimal allocation a significant challenge. The problem is a large-scale combinatorial optimization task with numerous constraints such as safety, track resources, system of working, signalling system, platform availability, train schedules, and train priorities. As real-time decisions become increasingly complex, there is a growing need for intelligent, data-driven systems powered by optimization algorithms and AI to enhance efficiency, punctuality, and utilization of railway infrastructure.

## Detailed Description

Currently, experienced traffic controllers oversee operations and take real-time decisions-whether a train should proceed, halt, or be rerouted-based on operational conditions and institutional knowledge. With rising traffic volumes and higher expectations for punctuality, safety, and efficiency, manual decision-making alone is becoming insufficient.

The network is constrained by finite infrastructure-limited track sections, junctions, crossings, and platform capacities-shared by long-distance express, suburban local, freight, maintenance blocks, and unscheduled specials. Coordinating these movements across spatial (network layout) and temporal (scheduling) dimensions while maintaining safety and minimizing delays is formidable.

Within a section managed by a section controller, the core problem is to decide train precedence and crossings to maximize throughput and minimize overall train travel time, considering section characteristics (e.g., line capacity, gradients, signal placements) and varying train priorities. This represents a dynamic, large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with an exponentially large solution space, further complicated by real-time disruptions (breakdowns, weather, rolling stock delays). Human intuition alone is no longer sufficient; intelligent decision-support tools are required to improve precision, scalability, and responsiveness.

## Expected Solution

An intelligent decision-support system that assists section controllers in making optimized, real-time decisions for train precedence and crossings. The system should:

- Leverage operations research and AI to model constraints, train priorities, and operational rules, producing conflict-free, feasible schedules dynamically.
- Maximize section throughput and minimize overall train travel time, with the ability to re-optimize rapidly under disruptions (e.g., incidents, delays, weather).
- Support what-if simulation and scenario analysis to evaluate alternative routings, holding strategies, and platform allocations.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for controllers with clear recommendations, explanations, and override capabilities.
- Integrate with existing railway control systems and data sources (signalling, TMS, timetables, rolling stock status) via secure APIs.
- Include audit trails, performance dashboards, and KPIs (punctuality, average delay, throughput, utilization) for continuous improvement.

**Problem ID:** 25025

**Organization:** Ministry of Ayush

**Department:** All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech

## Background

In Ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems, **Rasa (taste)** is a fundamental criterion for identifying, classifying, and determining the therapeutic value of medicinal herbs. While this taste-based assessment has been effective for centuries, it is inherently subjective, relying on human perception and expert experience, which often leads to variability and inconsistency.

In the modern context, ensuring the authenticity, quality, and standardization of herbal raw materials is a critical challenge due to widespread adulteration, batch-to-batch phytochemical variations, and the global demand for reliable herbal products.

Recent advances in **sensor science** and **analytical technologies** provide innovative solutions to these challenges. **Electronic tongue (e-tongue)** systems can mimic human gustatory mechanisms by detecting complex chemical signatures, while spectroscopic techniques such as **Near-Infrared (NIR), Raman,** and **UV-Visible spectroscopy** offer rapid, non-destructive chemical profiling of herbal samples.

When integrated with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** - such as chemometric modelling, neural networks, and pattern recognition-large datasets can be analyzed to classify herbs based on taste profiles, threshold levels, and phytochemical composition with high precision. This **AI-enabled, sensor-integrated approach** ensures faster, objective, and cost-effective quality assurance, bridging traditional Ayurvedic principles with modern scientific validation.

# Problem 26: Develop API code to integrate NAMASTE and or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) via the Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) into existing EMR systems that comply with Electronic Health Record (EHR) Standards for India.

**Problem ID:** 25026

**Organization:** Ministry of Ayush

**Department:** All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech

## Background

India’s Ayush sector is rapidly transitioning from paper-based records to interoperable digital health systems. Central to this transformation are two key coding systems: the National AYUSH Morbidity & Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMASTE) codes, which provide over 4,500 standardized terms for Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani disorders, WHO Standardised International Terminologies for Ayurveda and the WHO’s ICD-11, Chapter - 26, Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2), which integrates 529 disorder categories and 196 pattern codes into the global ICD framework. Harmonising these vocabularies within Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platforms not only enables accurate clinical documentation and decision support but also ensures compliance with India’s 2016 EHR Standards-mandating FHIR R4 APIs, SNOMED CT and LOINC semantics, ISO 22600 access control, ABHA-linked OAuth 2.0 authentication, and robust audit trails for consent and versioning.

To operationalize this dual-coding approach, EMR vendors must implement a lightweight terminology micro-service that ingests NAMASTE CSV and synchronises with the WHO-11 ICD-API (Including Biomedicine and TM2). Within the EMR user interface, diagnosis entries should support auto-complete widgets that return both NAMASTE and ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) codes, comply with the Coding rules of ICD-11 framework and store them together in the patient’s Problem List resource. This integration empowers clinicians to combine traditional and biomedical insights, facilitates Ayush insurance claims under global ICD-11 coding rules, and provides the Ministry of Ayush with real-time morbidity analytics aligned with national and international reporting standards.

## Description

Design and prototype an API integration that brings India’s NAMASTE terminologies, WHO Standardised International terminology and the WHO ICD-11 (Traditional Medicine Module 2 (TM2) & Biomedicine) into a FHIR-compliant Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. Your goal is to enable clinicians to record traditional medicine diagnoses (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) using NAMASTE codes, then automatically map them to global ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) identifiers-supporting dual/double-coding (One code denoting Ayurveda/Siddha/Unani (TM) and another denoting Biomedicine) for interoperability, analytics and insurance claims.

Your deliverable is a lightweight micro-service or FHIR terminology plugin offering:

- A FHIR compliant resource for NAMASTE codes linking to WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, ICD-11 (TM2 and Biomedicine) and compliant with ICD-11 Coding rules.
- A REST endpoint for auto-complete value-set lookup.
- A translation operation converting NAMASTE ↔ TM2 codes.
- An encounter upload endpoint that ingests FHIR Bundles with both code systems.
- OAuth 2.0-secured access using ABHA tokens and audit-ready metadata.

### Teams should demonstrate

1. Ingesting the NAMASTE CSV export and generating FHIR CodeSystem + ConceptMap.
2. Fetching TM2, Biomedicine updates from the WHO ICD-API and merging into your service.
3. A simple web or CLI interface to search NAMASTE terms, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, see mapped TM2 codes, and construct a FHIR ProblemList entry.
4. Version tracking and consent metadata to satisfy India’s 2016 EHR Standards (FHIR R4, ISO 22600, SNOMED-CT/LOINC semantics).

## Expected Solution

A lightweight, FHIR R4-compliant terminology micro-service-built to India’s 2016 EHR Standards-that exposes a NAMASTE CodeSystem, WHO International Terminologies of Ayurveda, an ICD-11 TM2, Biomedicine ConceptMap, an auto-complete value-set lookup endpoint, a NAMASTE↔TM2 translate operation; ICD-11 Biomedicine look up and a secure FHIR Bundle upload interface (for enabling double coding).

# Problem 27: Develop a blockchain-based system for botanical traceability of Ayurvedic herbs, including geo-tagging from the point of collection (farmers/wild collectors) to the final Ayurvedic formulation label.

**Problem ID:** 25027

**Organization:** Ministry of Ayush

**Department:** All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Blockchain & Cybersecurity

## Background

The Ayurvedic herbal supply chain in India is characterised by fragmented networks of smallholder farmers, wild collectors and multiple intermediaries, leading to challenges in ensuring consistent quality, authenticity and sustainable sourcing of medicinal plants. Variations in harvesting practices, environmental conditions and manual record-keeping introduce risks of mislabeling, adulteration and over-harvesting of vulnerable species, undermining consumer trust and compliance with regulatory standards. Geographic provenance is often undocumented or opaque, making it difficult for manufacturers and regulators to verify that herbs originate from approved regions or follow sustainable collection guidelines.

A blockchain-based traceability system, augmented with geo-tagging technology, can address these gaps by creating an immutable, decentralised ledger that records every step of the herb's journey-from on-site GPS-tagged collection events through processing, testing and formulation. Smart contracts on a permissioned network (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) can enforce sustainability criteria and automate quality validations, while IoT-enabled devices capture real-time location and environmental data at remote collection points, even via SMS-over-blockchain gateways where connectivity is sparse. By integrating FHIR-style metadata bundles (e.g., "CollectionEvent," "QualityTest," "ProcessingStep") and QR-code scanning at aggregation nodes, stakeholders gain end-to-end visibility, enabling rapid verification of provenance, streamlined certification for export and robust audit trails to support both biodiversity conservation and supply-chain efficiency. When herbs are formulated into finished products, unique, serialised QR codes generated by the blockchain platform could be affixed to each package. End customers scan these codes with a mobile app or web portal-powered by the same blockchain ledger-to retrieve a FHIR-style provenance bundle detailing each upstream event: farm of origin, harvest conditions, intermediary custody, laboratory certificates and batch formulation parameters. This consumer-facing transparency not only verifies authenticity and builds trust, but also supports ethical marketing, enables rapid recall management and fosters incentives for sustainable collection practices by linking premium pricing to verified harvest data. Over time, analytics on consumer scans can feed back into demand forecasting, closing the loop between consumer assurance and supply-chain optimisation.

## Description

A permissioned blockchain network will immutably record every stage of an Ayurvedic herb's journey-from geo-tagged harvest events by farmers or wild collectors, through multi-stage processing and laboratory testing, to the finished product on retail shelves. At the point of collection, GPS-enabled mobile or IoT devices capture precise location, timestamp, collector identity, species identification and initial quality metrics as a "Collection Event." Subsequent "Processing Step" and "Quality Test" events-each embedding standardised metadata bundles-are added by processing facilities and testing laboratories. Smart contracts enforce National Medicinal Plants Board sustainability guidelines and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices by automatically validating geo-fencing rules, seasonal restrictions and quality thresholds before committing each transaction to the ledger.

When formulation is complete, unique QR codes generated on-chain are affixed to product packaging. End customers scan these codes via a lightweight web or mobile portal (no specialised app required) to retrieve the full provenance record: farm coordinates and harvest conditions; chain-of-custody handoffs; lab certificates for moisture, pesticide and DNA-barcode tests; and sustainability and fair-trade compliance proofs. This consumer-facing transparency assures authenticity and safety, enables rapid recall notifications for affected batches and tells the story of each product-complete with interactive maps and farmer or community profiles. By combining tamper-proof audit trails, geo-tagged traceability and automated compliance enforcement, the system delivers a replicable model for ethical, sustainable and trust-driven Ayurvedic herb sourcing.

## Expected Solution

Participants will deliver a proof-of-concept blockchain-based botanical traceability system addressing end-to-end provenance of Ayurvedic herbs. The solution should include the following core components and capabilities:

### 1. Permissioned Blockchain Network

- A lightweight, permissioned ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric or Corda) that records every supply-chain transaction.
- Network nodes representing farmers' cooperatives, wild-collector groups, testing laboratories, processing facilities and manufacturers.
- Smart contracts enforcing:
- Geo-fencing rules based on collectors' GPS coordinates and approved harvesting zones.
- Seasonal-harvest restrictions and species-specific conservation limits per National Medicinal Plants Board guidelines.
- Quality-gate validations (e.g., moisture thresholds, pesticide limits, DNA barcoding checks).

### 2. Geo-Tagged Data Capture

- IoT/GPS-enabled mobile DApp (or SMS-over-blockchain gateway) for collectors to record "CollectionEvent" metadata: latitude/longitude, timestamp, collector ID, species and initial quality metrics.
- Sensor integrations or manual interfaces for "QualityTest" events (lab results) and "ProcessingStep" events (drying, grinding, storage conditions).

### 3. Smart Labeling & Consumer Portal

- On-chain generation of unique QR codes for each finished product batch.
- A lightweight web/mobile portal (no specialised install required) allowing end customers to scan QR codes and retrieve a complete FHIR-style provenance bundle:
- Collection location map and harvest details
- Chain-of-custody handoffs through each supply-chain node
- Laboratory certificates for moisture, pesticide analysis, DNA authentication
- Sustainability compliance proofs and fair-trade verifications
- Interactive farmer/community profiles and conservation credentials

### 4. Integration & Interoperability

- RESTful APIs for supply-chain managers to query real-time dashboards of harvest volumes, batch statuses, QA results and sustainability metrics.
- Plugins or connectors to existing ERP/quality-management systems for seamless data exchange.
- Use of FHIR-style resource models (CollectionEvent, QualityTest, ProcessingStep, Provenance) for standardized metadata exchange.

### 5. User Interfaces & Reporting

- A mobile DApp interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, with offline data capture and SMS synchronization.
- A web dashboard for stakeholders to monitor network health, query provenance records and generate compliance reports aligned with AYUSH Ministry export and sustainability requirements.
- Automated reporting modules that compile environmental-impact metrics and conservation compliance data for certification bodies.

### 6. Demonstration & Evaluation

- A live pilot using one botanical species (e.g., Ashwagandha) across a small farming cooperative and a collaborating processor.
- End-to-end demonstration: geo-tagging harvest, adding lab results, processing events, QR code scanning by simulated consumers and recall simulation.

# Problem 36: Development of Sensor for Detection Of Microplastics

**Problem ID:** 25036

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Background

Microplastics - plastic particles less than 5 mm in size - have emerged as a global environmental threat, contaminating oceans, freshwater systems, and even drinking water. These particles originate from the degradation of larger plastics or from microbeads in consumer products. Their persistence and bioaccumulative nature pose serious risks to aquatic life, ecosystems, and potentially human health. Current methods for detecting microplastics - such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy - are often accurate but time-consuming, expensive, and laboratory-dependent, limiting their application for real-time, field-based monitoring.

## Description

The project aims to develop a low-cost, efficient, and portable sensor capable of detecting microplastics in various water sources. The focus may be on using optical detection techniques - such as light scattering, fluorescence, or absorbance - combined with machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition. The sensor may be designed to identify microplastic particles based on their optical signatures, size distribution, and possibly polymer type. Water samples shall pass through a detection chamber, where embedded sensors capture spectral or visual data. This information would be processed in real time, either on-device or via a connected application. The system should be tested using standard microplastic samples (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene) and validated against existing lab-based techniques.

## Expected Solution

The expected outcome is a compact, field-deployable sensor system that can detect and quantify microplastics in water samples within minutes. It should offer reasonable sensitivity (down to 10-100 μm), operate on battery or solar power, and require minimal sample preparation. Additionally, the solution may include a companion software interface for data logging, visualization, and analysis. This innovation should have strong potential for adoption in microplastic monitoring, supporting researchers, environmental agencies, and water quality managers in making faster, data-driven decisions for pollution control and mitigation.

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Background

Grain size is a fundamental property used to classify beach types and plays a critical role in influencing coastal morphodynamic processes. However, measuring grain size is particularly challenging, as it requires scientists to visit each site to collect sediment samples. These samples must then undergo time-consuming physical processing in the laboratory to determine their characteristics. Moreover, because beach sediments are dynamic and constantly changing due to wave action, tides, and weather events, this process must be repeated regularly to maintain accurate and up-to-date data.

## Description

The above problem statement envisages that a low-cost camera-based automated mapping system be developed to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of the sandy beach area (i.e., berm, intertidal, and dune) and classify the beach category of the measurement region. A low-cost camera-based mapping system, along with automated prediction algorithms, is used to estimate the sediment grain size distribution of a particular area of interest to be developed. Also, this system should incorporate a GNSS/GPS receiver to map the geographic positions of the measurement location.

## Expected Solution

A low-cost camera-based mapping system with a GNSS/GPS receiver should be developed with an automated image processing algorithm for beach sand grain size estimation/classification. Validation should be performed at least on one sample based on data collected in the area of interest.

# Problem 40: FloatChat - AI-Powered Conversational Interface for ARGO Ocean Data Discovery and Visualization

**Problem ID:** 25040

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Background

Oceanographic data is vast, complex, and heterogeneous - ranging from satellite observations to in-situ measurements like CTD casts, Argo floats, and BGC sensors. The Argo program, which deploys autonomous profiling floats across the world’s oceans, generates an extensive dataset in NetCDF format containing temperature, salinity, and other essential ocean variables. Accessing, querying, and visualizing this data requires domain knowledge, technical skills, and familiarity with complex formats and tools. With the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), especially when combined with modern structured databases and interactive dashboards, it is now feasible to create intuitive, accessible systems that democratize access to ocean data.

## Description

The current problem statement proposes the development of an AI-powered conversational system for ARGO float data that enables users to query, explore, and visualize oceanographic information using natural language.

The current system shall:

- Ingest ARGO NetCDF files and convert them into structured formats (like SQL/Parquet).
- Use a vector database (like FAISS/Chroma) to store metadata and summaries for retrieval.
- Leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by multimodal LLMs (such as GPT, QWEN, LLaMA, or Mistral) to interpret user queries and map them to database queries (SQL). (Use Model Context Protocol (MCP))

# Problem 41: AI-Driven Unified Data Platform for Oceanographic, Fisheries, and Molecular Biodiversity Insights

**Problem ID:** 25041

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Renewable / Sustainable Energy

## About CMLRE

CMLRE, Kochi, an attached office under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a key role in organising and promoting ocean development activities in India, with a focus on mapping, assessing, and managing marine living resources in the Indian EEZ. The Marine Living Resources Programme supports ecosystem-based research and monitoring, aimed at sustainable utilisation of these resources through scientific surveys, environmental studies, and data-driven ecosystem modelling.

## Background

India, with its vast coastline and rich marine biodiversity, relies heavily on the health of its ocean ecosystems for food security, climate regulation, and economic development. The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, plays a pivotal role in collecting, managing, and analysing a broad spectrum of marine data to support sustainable ocean resource management.

## Detailed Description

CMLRE's datasets are diverse, complex, and multidisciplinary, including physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; fish abundance, species diversity, life history traits, and ecomorphology; fish taxonomy and otolith morphology; molecular biology data, including environmental DNA (eDNA) for species detection and biodiversity assessments. These datasets exist across various formats (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and are stored in siloed systems, making cross-domain integration, real-time visualization, and advanced analytics nearly impossible. This creates a major bottleneck for marine scientists, conservationists, and policymakers who need to make data-driven decisions for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management.

CMLRE seeks an AI-enabled, intelligent digital platform that can integrate heterogeneous and high-volume datasets from oceanography, taxonomy, morphology, and molecular biology into a single unified system. The platform should support automated data ingestion, standardisation, and metadata tagging using internationally accepted formats, enable cross-disciplinary correlation analysis to study how ocean parameters influence biodiversity, fish distribution, and ecosystem health, and incorporate interactive modules for otolith shape and morphometrics visualisation, taxonomic classification and species identification, and molecular and eDNA data storage/retrieval and species matching.

### Why It Matters

This platform will serve as a national marine data backbone, empowering India's scientific community with a next-generation tool for holistic marine ecosystem assessment. It will improve the efficiency of marine biodiversity research, enhance real-time decision-making, and support blue economy initiatives by enabling sustainable fisheries and conservation planning through integrated data insights.

## Expected Deliverables

- A robust, cloud-ready web platform prototype.
- Scalable backend architecture with modular data ingestion pipelines.
- Visualisation tools for oceanographic and biodiversity trends.
- Integrated modules for managing taxonomy, otolith morphology, and eDNA data.
- Well-documented APIs and user manuals for future adoption and scaling.

# Problem 42: Identifying Taxonomy and Assessing Biodiversity from eDNA Datasets

**Problem ID:** 25042

**Organization:** Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)

**Department:** Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Background

The deep ocean, encompassing vast and remote ecosystems like abyssal plains, hydrothermal vents, and seamounts, harbors a significant portion of global biodiversity, much of which remains undiscovered due to its inaccessibility. Understanding deep-sea biodiversity is critical for elucidating ecological interactions (e.g., food webs, nutrient cycling), informing conservation strategies for vulnerable marine habitats, and identifying novel eukaryotic species with potential biotechnological or ecological significance.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for studying these ecosystems by capturing genetic traces of organisms from environmental samples, such as seawater or sediment, without the need for physical collection or disturbance of fragile habitats. By targeting marker genes like 18S rRNA or COI, eDNA enables the detection of diverse eukaryotic taxa, including protists, cnidarians, and rare metazoans, offering insights into species richness and community structure.

## Description

The Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology (CMLRE) will undertake routine voyages to the deep sea and collect sediment and water samples from hotspot regions for biodiversity assessment and ecosystem monitoring. The water and sediment samples will be used to extract eDNA and will be subject to high-throughput sequencing.

However, assigning raw eDNA sequencing reads to eukaryotic taxa or inferring their ecological roles presents significant challenges, primarily due to the poor representation of deep-sea organisms in reference databases like SILVA, PR2, or NCBI. These databases, built primarily from well-studied terrestrial or shallow-water species, lack comprehensive sequences for deep-sea eukaryotes, leading to misclassifications, unassigned reads, or underestimation of biodiversity.

Traditional bioinformatic pipelines for eDNA analysis, such as those implemented in QIIME2, DADA2, or mothur, rely heavily on sequence alignment or mapping to these databases, which is inadequate for novel or divergent deep-sea taxa. This dependency limits the discovery of new species and hinders accurate biodiversity assessments, critical for conservation in rapidly changing deep-sea environments. The computational time required for processing eDNA data exacerbates these challenges, particularly given the limitations of database-dependent methods and the complexity of eDNA datasets.

## Expected Solution

To address the challenges of poor database representation and computational time in deep-sea eDNA analysis, we propose an **AI-driven pipeline** that uses deep learning and unsupervised learning to identify eukaryotic taxa and assess biodiversity directly from raw eDNA reads. The solution should be able to classify the sequences, annotate and estimate abundance. This solution minimizes reliance on reference databases, reduces computational time through optimized workflows, and enables the discovery of novel taxa and ecological insights in deep-sea ecosystems.

## Description

This problem statement envisages developing an **embedded intelligent system** that can be integrated directly with microscopic imaging devices used in marine biological studies. The system should leverage **embedding-based deep learning techniques** to identify and count microscopic marine organisms captured through microscopy images. The embedded platform should be optimized for low computational resources, enabling accurate, rapid, and automated analysis without manual intervention.

The solution should specifically handle diverse challenges encountered in microscopic imaging, such as overlapping organisms, variations in morphology, illumination inconsistencies, and imaging artifacts. It must accurately classify and quantify different species present in microscopic images to facilitate marine biodiversity assessments efficiently.

## Expected Solution

An embedded microscopy-integrated AI system featuring:

- Lightweight deep learning models deployable on embedded computational hardware.
- Automatic species/genus-level identification of microscopic marine organisms from microscopy images.
- Accurate and automated counting of individual organisms per species.
- Capability for onboard processing, storage, and reporting of species identification and counts for subsequent ecological analysis.

Onion is a semi-perishable vegetable and is harvested during the rabi season, accounting for 65% of onion production, and hits the markets from April to May. The same crop must continue to meet the consumer demand till the month of October-November every year, before the kharif crop is harvested and brought to the market. It is therefore vital to store onions successfully in order to meet the regular supply. It is observed that nearly 30-40% of the crop is lost during storage due to various reasons in form of physiological weight loss, rotting, sprouting etc. In unexpected situations such as natural calamities, the losses even go beyond 50% creating heavy stress both on the demand and supply sides. The losses that occurred during storage are in terms of qualitative as well as in quantitative ways. Hence, it is imperative to take some crucial steps pertaining to onion storage with minimum losses to ensure an adequate supply to the market, thereby reducing the price fluctuations.

Various abiotic factors like temperature, relative humidity affect the health of onions; hence, their balance is essential to store the crop with minimum losses. Recent technological advancements (such as Design, Solar/Plasma/Irradiation energy, Nanotechnology, IoT including AI/ML) also offer an opportunity to provide infrastructure for onion storage and supply chain, besides value addition, even in rural India. Design innovations are pervading various sectors, including efficient onion storage at the farm level, rural as well as urban markets. Different process and product development advances will fetch better returns to farmers and competitive prices for consumers. More importantly, it will help in addressing the present as well as the impending challenges.

## Expected Solution

Extension of shelf life with minimum loss.

# Problem 56: To explore new/altermative assaying methods to the fire assay method for testing of gold jewellery and artefacts through non-destructive testing

**Problem ID:** 25056

**Organization:** Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (MoCA,F&PD)

**Department:** Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS),Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Miscellaneous

## Background

Hallmarking is the accurate determination and official recording of the proportionate content of precious metal in the jewellery/artefacts or bullion/coins. The hallmarking of gold jewellery was started in year 2000 and has been made mandatory since 23 June 2021 and presently covers 361 districts.

The Indian Standard, IS 1417 2016 "Gold and gold alloys, jewellery/artefacts-fineness and marking specification" covers hallmarking of six grades of gold jewellery/gold artefacts viz. 14K, 18K, 20K, 22K, 23K and 24K carats. The Indian Standard, IS 1418: 2009 "Determination of gold in gold bullion, gold alloys and gold jewellery/artefacts - Cupellation (Fire Assay) method" prescribes the fire assay test method for determining the fineness of gold in gold bullion, alloys, and jewellery/artefacts.

The fire assay testing method, though globally accepted and accurate, involves a destructive testing process wherein a sample of 250-500 mg is taken from the item by scrapping, drilling, or cutting. The method may lead to the damage of the article, rendering it unsellable, especially when dealing with a few or single article. However, the gold loss incurred during testing is almost negligible. Additionally, the process emits hazardous substances like lead oxides and nitrous fumes.

Further, BIS has also formulated an Indian Standard on method of test using ED-XRF (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence), i.e., IS 18458: 2023 "Jewellery and precious metals ED-XRF test - Method of test". This Indian Standard prescribes a non-destructive testing method to verify the fineness of the gold jewellery. However, the use of ED-XRF as a non-destructive method to determine the fineness is only applicable to homogenous gold jewellery. In addition, IS 18458: 2023 also has a provision for determination of fineness of jewellery by destructive testing, which is more suited for non-homogeneous jewellery.

There is another Indian Standard developed by BIS, IS 16901: 2022 "Jewellery and precious metals determination of high purity gold, platinum and palladium - difference method using ICP-OES". This method uses ICP-OES and is applicable only for high purity gold (999 ppt and above). ICP-OES is also a destructive testing method.

India's gold jewellery industry is highly diverse, encompassing various types such as casted jewellery, handmade pieces with soldered joints, hollow and filled jewellery, gold-plated items, and studded ornaments using various jewellery manufacturing techniques. While casted jewellery is relatively homogeneous, the majority-particularly handmade and hollow varieties-are structurally complex and heterogeneous. This variability presents significant challenges in testing and hallmarking.

In the existing fire assay testing method, heterogeneity is addressed by melting the sample before testing. This eliminates impurities and ensures homogeneity. Moreover, fire assay being a difference method (based on initial and final weight of gold sample), the impact of heterogeneity is nullified. However, owing to its destructive nature, there is strong demand for an alternative non-destructive testing method.

## Expected Solution

1. Develop and implement a **non-destructive assaying method** that matches the accuracy of fire assay without damaging the jewellery, while being capable of handling heterogeneous compositions (solders, fillers, non-metallic substances).
2. Eliminate emissions of harmful substances (lead oxide, nitrous fumes).
3. Achieve repeatability close to that of fire assay, ideally within ±0.5 ppt (as per IS 1418).
4. Method selected will be validated for regulatory and commercial applications.

## Deliverables

1. Detailed non-destructive innovative testing method with technical explanation
2. References/bibliography related to the technical paper
3. Scientific principles underlying the approach
4. Feasibility studies and expected challenges
5. Methodology for validation including accuracy assessment
6. Explanatory note on potential for regulatory and commercial application

# Problem 63: Developing a cost effective solution for detecting the breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors

**Problem ID:** 25063

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Disaster Management

## Background

A cost-effective solution is required for detecting the breakage of Low Voltage AC Distribution Over Head conductors towards isolating the source of supply to prevent hazardous electric shock scenarios to the public, while also sending alarms to the concerned section office for immediate fault rectification.

Recently, several cases of accidental deaths of children and adults due to electrocution from broken live conductors lying on the ground were reported in Kerala. Low voltage distribution lines often snap due to falling trees during natural calamities and also due to aging or corrosion. This dangerous condition is not detected or isolated by upstream fuses in these feeders because of high earth resistance and low fault current, leading to electrocution deaths when people come into contact with live bare conductors. Many existing solutions identified so far are not cost-effective or viable for the vast distribution network.

## Expected Solution

An innovative solution based on IoT and AI, including edge intelligence, may provide an economical and scalable solution for this socially relevant problem faced by KSEBL.

# Problem 64: Improving the Renewable Energy hosting capacity in Distribution Feeders improving the Power quality of Distribution network during high RE injection

**Problem ID:** 25064

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kerala State Electricity Board Limited (KSEBL)

**Category:** Hardware

**Theme:** Renewable / Sustainable Energy

## Background

Kerala has a large penetration of Roof Top Solar PV systems amounting to nearly 1500 MW. These systems are connected to low voltage distribution feeders either in single-phase or three-phase mode. A majority of the systems are below 5 kW and hence get connected in single-phase, which causes severe unbalanced loading in feeders and results in an uneven voltage profile. This unbalanced loading also limits the quantum of PV that can be integrated into the network.

Any load balancing work carried out during daytime under PV injection gets negated during the evening peak hours when solar power is unavailable. This situation calls for a solution that can dynamically reconfigure the network based on renewable energy (RE) injection and local demand scenarios.

## Expected Solution

A cost-effective controller incorporating IoT and edge intelligence can be developed at the local node level for auto-balancing of the load across various phases in a feeder under the above conditions.

# Problem 79: Document Overload at Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)-An automated solution

**Problem ID:** 25080

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Problem Statement

Since its first commercial run in 2017, KMRL has grown into a complex, multidisciplinary enterprise that stretches far beyond train operations. Every business day the organization generates and receives thousands of pages of material: engineering drawings, maintenance job cards, incident reports, vendor invoices, purchase-order correspondence, regulatory directives, environmental-impact studies, safety circulars, HR policies, legal opinions, and board-meeting minutes. These arrive through e-mail, Maximo exports, SharePoint repositories, WhatsApp PDFs, hard-copy scans, and ad-hoc cloud links-often in both English and Malayalam, sometimes in bilingual hybrids, frequently with embedded tables, photos, or signatures. The sheer diversity and volume have created a silent productivity tax:

- Information latency: Front-line managers spend hours skimming lengthy documents for the few actionable lines that affect their shift, delaying decisions on train availability, contractor payments, or staffing reallocations.
- Siloed awareness: Procurement may negotiate a spare-parts contract without realizing that Engineering has already flagged an upcoming design change HR may schedule refresher training unaware of a new safety bulletin released the previous evening.
- Compliance exposure: Regulatory updates from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety and the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs are buried in inboxes, risking missed deadlines or audit non-conformities.
- Knowledge attrition: Institutional memory remains locked in static files when key personnel transfer or retire, hard-won insights vanish with them.
- Duplicated effort: Different teams independently create summaries or slide decks of the same source documents, multiplying manual work and version-control headaches.

As KMRL prepares to expand its corridor, add two new depots, and integrate emerging technologies such as Unified Namespace (UNS) data streams and IoT condition monitoring, the documentary burden will only intensify. Without an organization-wide mechanism to condense, contextualize, and route critical information, the metro risks slower decision cycles, avoidable operating costs, diminished service reliability, and heightened safety and legal vulnerabilities. The challenge, therefore, is to equip every stakeholder-from station controllers and rolling-stock engineers to finance officers and executive directors-with rapid, trustworthy snapshots of the documents that matter to them, while preserving traceability to the original source. Solving this problem will unlock faster cross-department coordination, strengthen regulatory compliance, safeguard institutional knowledge, and ultimately support KMRL’s mission of delivering safe, efficient, and passenger-centric urban transit to Kochi.

# Problem 80: AI-Driven Train Induction Planning & Scheduling for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)

**Problem ID:** 25081

**Organization:** Government of Kerala

**Department:** Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Problem Statement

Kochi Metro must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will enter revenue service at dawn, which remain on standby, and which are held back in the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance. The decision hinges on six inter-dependent variables:

1. Fitness Certificates - validity windows issued by Rolling-Stock, Signalling and Telecom departments.
2. Job-Card Status - open vs. closed work orders exported from IBM Maximo.
3. Branding Priorities - contractual commitments that dictate exterior wrap exposure hours.
4. Mileage Balancing - kilometre allocation to equalise bogie, brake-pad and HVAC wear.
5. Cleaning & Detailing Slots - available manpower and bay occupancy for interior deep-cleaning.
6. Stabling Geometry - physical bay positions that minimise nightly shunting and morning turn-out time.
   At present these data points reside in siloed spreadsheets, manual logbooks, and daily WhatsApp updates. Supervisors reconcile them in a time-compressed window (21:00-23:00 IST) using ad-hoc filters and experience-based heuristics. The process is opaque, non-repeatable, and highly error-prone:

   - Missing a single telecom clearance can force an unscheduled rake withdrawal, eroding the 99.5 % punctuality KPI.
   - Uneven mileage assignment accelerates component fatigue, inflating maintenance cost.
   - Inadequate visibility into branding priorities risks breaching advertiser SLAs, exposing KMRL to revenue penalties.
   - Excessive night-time shunting to rearrange rakes increases energy consumption and track-occupancy safety risk. With fleet size slated to grow to 40 trainsets and two depots by 2027, the existing manual workflow cannot scale linearly-neither in staffing nor in cognitive load. Therefore, KMRL requires an integrated, algorithm-driven decision-support platform that can:
   - Ingest heterogeneous inputs (Maximo exports, IoT fitness sensors, UNS streams, manual overrides) in near-real-time.
   - Enforce rule-based constraints and multi-objective optimisation (service readiness, reliability, cost, branding exposure).
   - Generate a ranked induction list with explainable reasoning, conflict alerts, and “what-if” simulation.
   - Learn from historical outcomes via machine-learning feedback loops to improve forecast accuracy over time.

Such a system will transform induction planning from a manual reconciliation exercise into a reproducible, auditable, data-driven process-delivering higher fleet availability, lower lifecycle cost, and an enhanced passenger experience while freeing operations staff to focus on strategic exceptions rather than routine data wrangling.

# Problem 89: One-Stop Personalized Career & Education Advisor

**Problem ID:** 25094

**Organization:** Government of Jammu and Kashmir

**Department:** Higher Education Department

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background

The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about:

- Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for.
- What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.
- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.
- Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible.

This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education.

## Description

The above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.

### Key Features of the App/Web Platform

- **Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion** Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.
- **Course-to-Career Path Mapping** Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.
- **Nearby Government Colleges Directory** Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).
- **Timeline Tracker** Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.
- **Customization and Personalization** User profiles created at login - tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:
  - Courses to apply for.
  - Colleges nearby.
  - Career paths aligned with their aptitude.
  - Study materials tailored to subject choice.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Stakeholder Collaboration** Involve government education departments, school teachers, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach.
- **Technology Development** Partner with EdTech developers to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features for poor internet areas.
- **Pilot Launch** Start in one or two districts with low college enrollment. Get feedback from students and teachers.
- **Full-Scale Rollout** Roll out state-wide or nationally through government schools and skill centers.
- **Monitoring & Feedback** Real-time analytics to track usage, app suggestions, successful transitions to college enrollment.

## Expected Solution

We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that acts as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor. The platform will be designed for students guiding them in choosing the right subject combination after class 12th, selecting suitable degree courses in local government colleges, understanding the long-term outcomes of different courses (jobs, entrance exams, skill development) and accessing open-source e-books, skill materials, and scholarships.

## Impact

- Improved enrollment in government degree colleges by helping students make informed academic decisions.
- Reduced dropouts after Class 10 and 12.
- Empowered students with access to reliable, localized career guidance.
- Stronger perception of government colleges as viable career-building institutions.

# Problem 94: AI-powered monitoring of crop health, soil condition, and pest risks using multispectral/hyperspectral imaging and sensor data.

**Problem ID:** 25099

**Organization:** MathWorks India Pvt. Ltd.

**Department:** MathWorks India Pvt. Ltd.

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Problem Statement

Agriculture faces growing threats from soil degradation, unpredictable weather, and pest outbreaks, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. Traditional monitoring methods are often delayed, labor-intensive, and lack precision. There is a need for a unified software platform that integrates remote sensing
and sensor data to provide timely, field-level insights on crop health, soil conditions, and pest risks using AI-driven analysis. Combining spectral imaging and environmental data enables early detection and targeted action, helping farmers shift from reactive to proactive crop management.

The solution is an AI-powered platform built using [Hyperspectral Imaging Library](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/76796-hyperspectral-imaging-library-for-image-processing-toolbox), [Image Processing Toolbox](https://in.mathworks.com/products/image-processing.html) and [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://in.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html). It ingests and aligns multispectral/hyperspectral image sequences with historical datasets, extracts vegetation and soil indices, and applies models like LSTM and CNN to detect trends and predict vegetation stress or disease risk. Environmental sensor data-such as soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and leaf wetness-is integrated to contextualize spectral anomalies, improve the accuracy of stress and pest predictions, and trigger zone-specific alerts.

Sensor inputs are fused with image-derived features to enhance temporal
modeling and identify conditions conducive to pest outbreaks or crop
decline. Target users include agronomists, researchers, field technicians, and progressive farmers who require timely, localized insights for monitoring and decision-making. Users interact through an intuitive dashboard that displays spectral health maps, temporal trend plots, anomaly alerts, soil condition summaries, and predicted risk zones.

The platform supports continuous learning, localized insights, and outputs reports and mobile-friendly notifications-empowering sustainable, precision agriculture through a scalable AI-driven system.

# Problem 95: Accelerating High-Fidelity Road Network Modeling for Indian Traffic Simulations.

**Problem ID:** 25100

**Organization:** MathWorks India Pvt. Ltd.

**Department:** MathWorks India Pvt. Ltd.

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Transportation & Logistics

## Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion in Indian cities is worsened by the limitations of current urban planning software, which often assumes ideal, well-maintained road conditions typical of developed countries. Such software fails to account for the unpredictable and nuanced realities of Indian roads-such as potholes, temporary barricades, partial lane closures, construction activities, and erratic driver behaviors.

Manually modeling these complex and dynamic road features into digital twins for realistic traffic simulations is both tedious and time-consuming, often requiring significant engineering effort before any meaningful simulation can be conducted.

To address this challenge, MathWorks is seeking innovative solutions to accelerate the creation of highly detailed digital twins of existing Indian road junctions and networks. The aim is to design toolsets, templates, asset libraries, or workflows-leveraging MATLAB, Simulink, Automated Driving Toolbox, RoadRunner, and potentially generative AI-that significantly streamline the process.

The solution should enable users to easily incorporate typical Indian road features and simulate hyper-local vehicular behaviors in their modeling, thereby empowering traffic management agencies to run realistic simulations for crisis handling, congestion management, and infrastructure planning.

Proposals should focus on enhancing the modeling process rather than traffic optimization and must integrate seamlessly with MATLAB-based simulation workflows.

# Problem 96: Remote classroom for rural colleges

**Problem ID:** 25101

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background

Rural diploma colleges often operate without subject Lecturers in various fields
such as artificial intelligence, VLSI, or renewable energy. Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide.

## Description

The challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions.

## Expected Solution

Student teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences.

# Problem 97: AI-based drop-out prediction and counseling system

**Problem ID:** 25102

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Background

By the time term-end marks reveal failures, many struggling students have disengaged beyond recovery. Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier.

## Description

Attendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously.
Commercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system
must be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using
machine learning.
Expected SoIution:
Participants are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.

# Problem 98: ERP-based Integrated Student Management system

**Problem ID:** 25103

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Background

Admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview.

## Description

Comprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate. Expected Solution:
Teams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.

# Problem 99: Language Agnostic Chatbot

**Problem ID:** 25104

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background

Campus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners..

## Description

While answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-AI services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.

## Expected Solution

Student innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner.

# Problem 100: Hybrid Renewable Energy Generation Solution

**Problem ID:** 25105

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Clean & Green Technology

## Background

Many public-sector campuses across Rajasthan consume substantial grid electricity even though solar irradiance and wind potential are favourable throughout most of the year. Separate pilot installations-rooftop photovoltaic panels on one block, a small wind turbine near another-have demonstrated value in isolation, yet they operate independently, lack coordinated scheduling, and cannot guarantee stable power when weather fluctuates. As tariff subsidies taper and carbon-reduction mandates tighten, institutes must find practical ways to maximise on-site renewable generation while preserving supply reliability for critical labs and hostels.

## Description

The crux of the challenge is orchestration, not hardware procurement. When the sun is at its peak, excess photovoltaic output sometimes exceeds immediate demand, while during cloudy afternoons or still evenings the turbine may produce little, forcing the campus to revert entirely to grid draw. Batteries, if present at all, are under-utilised because charge-discharge cycles are triggered by fixed rules rather than data-driven forecasts. Separate inverters, meters, and legacy control boxes provide fragmented read-outs that facilities staff inspect manually, often hours after the relevant events. Without a holistic view, administrators cannot determine when to schedule energy-intensive workshops, how to stagger HVAC loads, or whether to export surplus to the utility. Furthermore, campus management lacks clear evidence to justify additional renewable investments or to report carbon savings credibly. A modern, software-centric coordination layer is therefore needed to treat solar, wind, battery storage, and grid import as a single virtual power plant. Such a platform would ingest real-time sensor streams, fuse them with short-term weather forecasts, predict generation and demand curves; and recommend charge, discharge, or curtailment actions that minimise cost, and emissions. Crucially, the solution must remain usable by non-specialist technicians: dashboards must highlight actionable insights rather than raw kilowatt data; alert thresholds should be adjustable through simple menus; and historical analytics must export seamlessly for statutory reporting Because pilot hardware configurations vary widely from campus to campus, the orchestration software must stay agnostic to specific panel brands, turbine controllers, or battery chemistries, relying instead on open data interfaces or easily scripted adapters. By focusing on an interoperable, software-only intelligence layer, the hackathon team sidesteps heavy capital expenditure while unlocking the full potential of hardware assets the institution already owns. A successful proof-of-concept will demonstrate that thoughtful data modelling and optimisation can boost renewable utilisation, shrink electricity bills, and provide a replicable blueprint for other government campuses.

## Expected Solution

Participants should outline a comprehensive, vendor-neutral software framework that continuously integrates live generation and consumption data, applies predictive analytics to forecast both supply and dermand, and issues real-time operational recommendations such as optimal battery charging windows or load-shifting opportunities to maximise self-consumption of solar-wind energy, reduce grid dependence, and facilitate transparent reporting of carbon savings, while remaining simple enough for facilities staff to adopt without specialised training or additional hardware expenditure.

# Problem 101: Internship/Industrial Training with Placement Opportunity

**Problem ID:** 25106

**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan

**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background

Every student of technical education must complete an internship or industrial-training module before graduation and most also aspire to convert that opportunity into a full-time placement. Yet, within various colleges of technical education, the path from ""looking for an internship"" to ""signing a placement offer"" remains troublesome. Notices appear on scattered WhatsApp groups, resumes travel by email, and approval signatures require multiple office visits. Students miss deadlines, mentors lose track of who applied where, and the placement cell spends evenings stitching together spreadsheets simply to learn how many seats are still unfilled. While local industries also benefit from smoother workflows, the primary pain is felt inside the campus: learners waste effort on administrative chase cycles and the placement office drowns in manual status updates instead of focusing on employability coaching.

## Description

A campus-centric software platform could replace this maze of PDFs, emails, and manual ledgers with a single source of truth. Students would maintain one digital profile cover letter, resume, skills badge sheet updated once per semester. The placement cell would publish openings tagged by required competencies, department, stipend range, and potential placement conversion. A recommendation engine could surface the best-fit roles to each learner, who then applies with a single click. Faculty mentors would receive automated approval requests, interview calendars would synchronise with academic timetables, and real-time dashboards would show how many students remain unplaced or how many interviews are scheduled this week. After training, supervisors would log feedback directly in the portal, triggering certificate generation and automatically updating the student's employability record, which recruiters can later verify. Because public institutes operate on tight budgets, the solution must remain licence-free or very low-cost, leveraging existing institutional infrastructure, and adhere to strict data-privacy norms, providing role-based access so employers view only relevant candidate information. By focusing squarely on the needs of students and the placement cell, the platform would turn internship hunting from a manual scavenger hunt into a transparent, data-driven, and career-oriented journey. Expected Solution:
Participants should propose an integrated, role-based software portal that enables the placement cell to post verified internship and industrial-training opportunities, automatically matches and notifies eligible students according to their skills and preferences, streamlines mentor approvals and interview scheduling, tracks each applicant's journey from application to offer, and records supervisor feedback to generate completion certificates and placement analytics thereby simplifying every step for students and campus staff while remaining flexible, secure, and fully software-driven.

# Problem 150: Transliterations tool for street signs

**Problem ID:** 25155

**Organization:** AICTE

**Department:** Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Heritage & Culture

## Problem Statement

Bharat has always been a land of many languages flourishing together. The multitude of scripts thrived and have been instrumental in the preservation of the knowledge without losing the continuity. Today, many people are not able to read signboards in local languages due to their inability to read a different script. The challenge is to develop a app that can transliterate (Not translate) any script of Bharat into another script. For example, a person from Andhra Pradesh must be able to read the road signs in Gurumukhi when traveling in Punjab, or a pilgrim visiting Thiruvananthapuram from Manipur should be able to read the signs in Malayalam through a transliteration app.

# Problem 151: Instruments in observational Astronomy

**Problem ID:** 25156

**Organization:** AICTE

**Department:** Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Heritage & Culture

## Problem Statement

Indian Astronomers had developed a range of instruments to observe the sky. For example, the Samrat Yantra, Rama Yantra, Digamsa Yantra, Dhruva-Protha-Chakra Yanra, yantra-samrat (Combination of Samrat Yantra and Dhruva-Protha-Chakra Yanra), Golayantra chakra yantra, Bhitti Yantra, Dakshinottara Bhitti Yantra, Rasivalaya Yantra, Nadi valaya yantra, Palaka yantra, Chaapa yantra, are some of the yantras used to keep track of time, track celestial objects and used to develop models to predict astronomical events such as eclipses. Many of these have been built across the country in various places like Delhi, Jaipur, Varanasi, and Ujjain. Naturally, these instruments were calibrated for the latitude and longitude of a particular location. Ujjain (now Dongla, in Madhya Pradesh) was used as the reference point for timekeeping and measuring longitudes. Incidentally, the reference was changed to Greenwich only in the last 250 years. The challenge is to develop software that will generate the dimensions of these instruments for any latitude and longitude in India.

# Problem 153: Chandas Identifier

**Problem ID:** 25158

**Organization:** AICTE

**Department:** Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Problem Statement

Chandas Shastra (called Prosody in English) is the study of rythms in poetry. The syllables are classified as laghu (Short) or guru (Long) and the patterns of arrangement of laghu and guru syllables determine the type of chandas. Understanding the guru and laghu syllables is essential for proper pronunciation and correct recitation of poetry in the majority of Indian languages. There are seven major Chandas identified in the literature along with many other patterns. Acharya Pingala's Chandas shastra is a seminal work that describes these in detail and has binary numbers, combinatorial mathematics, and binomial coefficients. It also discusses some of the algorithms for interconversion of binary numbers and introduces the concept called 'Pascal's triangle' at least 1.5 millennia before Pascal, and was called 'Meru prastara' by Halayudha, a 10th-century commentator of Pingala's chandarshastra. The challenge is to develop a program that correctly identifies the chandas of any given Shloka.

# Problem 154: Real-Time AI/ML-Based Phishing Detection and Prevention System.

**Problem ID:** 25159

**Organization:** AICTE

**Department:** Cyber Security Cell

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Blockchain & Cybersecurity

## Background

Phishing attacks have evolved into highly sophisticated cyber threats exploiting human psychology, weak security configurations, and gaps in legacy detection mechanisms. Threat actors now leverage Machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL), and natural language generation (NLG) to create context-aware phishing campaigns that bypass signature- and rule-based security systems. Attack vectors are no longer limited to email; they now span SMS, instant messaging platforms, and websites using domain spoofing, homoglyph attacks, and redirection chains. The dynamic and polymorphic nature of these attacks has rendered traditional anti-phishing mechanisms-such as static URL blacklists, regex-based filters, and signature matching-ineffective against zero-day exploits.

## Problem Statement

Current anti-phishing ecosystems lack the technical adaptability and intelligence required to detect and mitigate emerging threats in real time. The main technical limitations include:

- Static Detection Models: Legacy tools rely on rule-based engines and signature libraries that fail against dynamically generated URLs, short-lived domains, and polymorphic attack payloads.
- Insufficient NLP/ML Analysis: Many systems lack advanced contextual and semantic analysis, resulting in undetected threats embedded in AI-generated or obfuscated messages.
- Complex Link Obfuscation: Phishing URLs often employ techniques like multiple HTTP 3xx redirection hops, Base64/hex encoding, and URL parameter cloaking, evading traditional scanners.
- Latency in Detection: Many security platforms perform post-delivery scans or asynchronous sandboxing, providing alerts after the end-user has engaged with the malicious link or attachment.
- Poor Model Generalization: ML classifiers trained on historical datasets often exhibit model drift and fail to generalize to zero-day phishing campaigns without active retraining pipelines.
- Limited Endpoint and Browser Integration: Available solutions are primarily cloud- or gateway-based, lacking lightweight real-time integrations with browsers, mail clients, and endpoint security agents.

The inability to provide real-time, adaptive, and explainable threat detection significantly increases the probability of credential harvesting, session hijacking, ransomware deployment, and large-scale data breaches.

## Proposed Solution

We propose the development of a real-time phishing detection and prevention framework powered by deep learning, advanced NLP, and graph-based analytics, designed to integrate seamlessly into enterprise environments and end-user platforms.

Key components include:

### Multi-Modal Data Analysis

- Textual Analysis: Transformer-based NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for semantic and syntactic parsing of email bodies, headers, and SMS content.
- Visual/Structural Analysis: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze webpage DOM structures, rendering patterns, and brand impersonation markers.

### Graph-Based Link and Domain Analysis

- Graph neural networks (GNNs) for relationship mapping between domains, subdomains, WHOIS records, SSL fingerprints, and DNS history.
- Identification of hidden malicious infrastructure through link traversal and detection of domain clustering patterns.

### Adversarial Detection Layer

- Models trained to detect anomalies in AI-generated phishing content, leveraging embeddings from large language models and classifiers fine-tuned for adversarial intent detection.

### Continuous Learning Pipeline

- Online training pipelines for incremental learning from live threat feeds, user feedback, and new IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
- Automated retraining and validation workflows to prevent model drift.

### Edge and Endpoint Integration

- Lightweight browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, integrating with email clients like Outlook and Gmail.
- Real-time local inference for sub-50 ms decision latency to ensure seamless user experience.

### Threat Intelligence & Sandbox Integration

- Bidirectional integration with open-source threat intelligence feeds (MISP, AlienVault OTX) and dynamic sandbox environments for behavioural analysis of links and attachments.

## Expected Outcomes

- Detection Accuracy: Over 95% true positive rate with a false-positive rate below 2%, validated through large-scale datasets and red-team simulations.
- Zero-Day Readiness: Adaptive ML pipelines enabling near-instant detection of emerging phishing campaigns.
- Scalability: Cloud-native microservice architecture supporting enterprise-wide deployments and individual user integration.
- Operational Efficiency: Real-time alerts (<100 ms latency) without impacting system performance.
- Cross-Sector Usability: A unified security tool applicable to educational institutions, SMBs, large enterprises, and government agencies.

# Problem 155: AI-Driven Next-Generation Firewall for Dynamic Threat Detection and Zero Trust Implementation

**Problem ID:** 25160

**Organization:** AICTE

**Department:** Cyber Security Cell

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Blockchain & Cybersecurity

## Background

The rapid proliferation of cloud-native infrastructures, remote workforce environments, and IoT/IIoT ecosystems has rendered traditional stateful firewalls obsolete. Static rule-based inspection mechanisms are inadequate to detect polymorphic malware, encrypted command-and-control (C2) channels, supply chain attacks, and zero-day exploits that leverage advanced evasion techniques. Attackers increasingly use AI-driven offensive tools, adversarial machine learning (AML), and living-off-the-land (LotL) strategies to bypass legacy defences.

Furthermore, TLS/SSL encryption now accounts for over 80% of network traffic, severely limiting visibility for signature-based firewalls. The shift toward Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) - characterized by continuous verification, micro-segmentation, and least-privilege enforcement - demands a context-aware, dynamically adaptive security system capable of real-time threat intelligence and proactive remediation.

## Problem Statement

Current NGFWs lack cognitive capabilities for advanced pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and real-time automated mitigation. Limitations include:

- Inability to de-anonymize and analyze encrypted traffic (TLS 1.3, QUIC) without compromising performance.
- Static security policies that cannot dynamically adapt to new Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) or MITRE ATT&CK® TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- Minimal integration with Zero Trust principles, leaving organizations vulnerable to insider threats and credential abuse.
- Limited utilization of cloud-scale AI/ML for federated learning and predictive analytics, resulting in delayed or insufficient responses to emerging attack vectors.

## Proposed Solution

Design and develop an AI-powered Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) that integrates Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and graph-based anomaly detection for intelligent, context-aware security enforcement. The system will include:

### Advanced Traffic Analysis

- Deploy Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) combined with SSL/TLS inspection powered by Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify encrypted traffic with minimal latency.
- Integrate unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection in real-time data streams.

### Zero Trust Integration

- Enforce adaptive policy control using risk-based authentication (RBA) and behavioural biometrics for user and device verification.
- Implement micro-segmentation at the software-defined perimeter (SDP) level to contain lateral movement.

### Federated AI for Threat Intelligence

- Use federated learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Federated, PySyft) to share anonymized model updates across distributed NGFW deployments while maintaining data privacy.
- Correlate external threat intelligence feeds (STIX/TAXII standards) with internal telemetry for predictive defence and proactive rule updates.

### Automated Incident Response

- Integrate Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) workflows to trigger automated containment, quarantine, or sandboxing of malicious entities.
- Utilize reinforcement learning models to optimize firewall rule sets dynamically based on evolving attack patterns.

### Unified Visibility and Analytics

- Provide a real-time security operations dashboard with advanced visualization of attack graphs, anomaly heatmaps, and threat correlation matrices.
- Support integration with SIEM/SOAR platforms like Splunk, ELK, or Azure Sentinel via APIs for centralized monitoring.

## Expected Outcomes

- A production-ready prototype demonstrating:

  - Sub-second detection and mitigation latency for threats, including zero-day attacks and polymorphic malware.
  - Seamless enforcement of Zero Trust principles with adaptive access controls.
  - Predictive threat modelling powered by continuous learning pipelines.
  - High throughput performance validated through benchmarks (≥40 Gbps inspection with <1ms latency) for enterprise-scale environments.

- Compatibility across multi-cloud, hybrid, and on-premise deployments with support for edge computing in IoT/IIoT ecosystems.
- Compliance with standards such as NIST SP 800-207, ISO/IEC 27001, and MITRE ATT&CK framework.

# Problem 157: Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) based IC marking to identify fake marking

**Problem ID:** 25162

**Organization:** Bharat Electronics Limited(BEL)

**Department:** Product Development & Innovation Centre (PDIC)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Description

The AOI based system should able to capture the IC part marking and verify the markings with the OEM given sequence.

## Background

In huge volume electronics equipment production, a large number of ICs from various OEMs are being used. Some of the ICs procurement may be in few lakhs quantities. Due to L1 basis of procurement process, it's possible some of the IC's are fake. Currently our internal QA team checks these markings on sampling basis. This is time consuming and a manual process. In addition, since it is done on sample basis it is possible some of the fake components still get through. Since it's done manually, it's prone to human errors also.

## Detailed Description

Identification of fake components in large volume production is a time consuming process. The Quality Assurance(QA) personnel do it manually by checking with the documents uploaded by the design team. Sometimes, the fake IC may be mixed with genuine ICs to increase the profit margins. When the boards with the fake components fail, it becomes tedious for the testing and the design team to identify the root cause of the issue as fake IC being used. This causes inordinate delay in production leading to loss in profits, due to LD cause.

## Expected Solution

An automated inspection system that can continuously scan the IC markings, compare with the marking details from the OEM datasheet and declare if the components are genuine or fake. Sometimes these details are given in a separate document by the OEM on their website. The system should also be intelligent enough to query on the internet and identify the document, download and search the relevant section to identify the part marking details for a particular IC package.

# Problem 159: Designing an Efficient Algorithm for Coordinated Swarm Engagement among Autonomous Drones aiming to neutralize an adversarial drone swarm.

**Problem ID:** 25164

**Organization:** Bharat Electronics Limited(BEL)

**Department:** Central Research Laboratory

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Robotics and Drones

## Background

Modern armed conflicts increasingly involve the deployment of autonomous drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and offensive operations. Currently, most anti-drone strategies rely on traditional Air Defence systems or Electronic Warfare techniques such as jamming. However, these methods may be limited in effectiveness, scalability, or cost. An alternative is to use autonomous drone swarms to counter adversarial drone swarms, leveraging decentralized coordination, adaptive behaviour, and real-time decision-making to neutralize threats more efficiently.

## Detailed Description

To develop an effective solution for autonomous swarm-based drone counter engagement, the following assumptions and requirements must be considered:

1. Armament Capability: Each drone is with armament capability. It is to be assumed that the adversary's drones are also similarly armed.
2. Environmental Perception: Drones must be equipped with appropriate sensors (e.g., Radar, LiDAR, Vision systems) to detect and track other drones within their operational vicinity. Additionally, drones should be able to classify targets as friendly or hostile based on sensor inputs and identification protocols.
3. Swarm Coordination Algorithm: A robust and efficient algorithm is required to coordinate the swarm in real time. This algorithm should enable autonomous drones to collaboratively execute efficient manoeuvres for engaging hostile drones and optimise the overall effectiveness of the swarm in tackling threat from hostile drones. Effectiveness means protecting ground assets and minimizing loss of friendly drones.

The primary objective of this problem is to develop a decentralized swarm manoeuvre algorithm for autonomous drones operating in a protective role. The algorithm should enable drones to collectively execute swarming manoeuvres-swarming means quickly bringing more forces together against a smaller enemy to gain an advantage, while staying away from battles where the enemy has more troops.

The protective drone swarm's mission is to protect designated ground assets from hostile drone swarms. Therefore, the algorithm must ensure that no enemy drone with ground attack capabilities\* is left unattended** if it is within a threatening range\*** of any friendly asset. Prioritization and dynamic threat assessment are critical.

Given the inherent complexity and scalability challenges of centralized control, the swarm must operate in a distributed and autonomous manner. The algorithm is to be embedded in each drone individually, enabling local decision-making without reliance on a central controller. While it may be assumed that drones possess inter-drone and drone-to-ground communication capabilities, the algorithm must be designed to function effectively even in the complete absence of communication. Communication, if available, may be used to enhance performance but should not be a dependency.

## Expected Solution

The expected outcome is a swarm control algorithm that enables friendly autonomous drones to collaboratively engage and neutralize an adversarial drone swarm using effective swarming manoeuvre. The algorithm must prioritize the protection of designated ground assets, ensuring that no enemy drone capable of attacking ground targets is left unattended within a threatening range.

The solution should be decentralized in nature, allowing each drone to operate autonomously based on its local perception and on-board intelligence. While limited communication between drones and with the ground station can be assumed to be available, the algorithm must not be dependent on continuous communication for core functionality. It should demonstrate robust and satisfactory performance even in communication-denied or degraded environments.

To validate the solution’s effectiveness, a stochastic simulation framework must be implemented to evaluate the algorithm through executions across a diverse set of scenarios and each scenario being executed multiple times. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is required to facilitate visual representation and interaction with the simulation results. (For Technical Specifications of Drone Refer Table)

### Ground Attack Capabilities

Enemy drones are assumed to be of two types.

1. Drones armed with air to air weapon, which will be a threat to friendly drones.
2. Drones with ground attack capability.

### Left Unattended

An enemy drone is unattended if there is no friendly drone either in firing range or in a position to intercept on its path to possible ground target.

### Threatening Range

Threatening range can be defined as 10 times the speed of drone. Because if a drone with ground attacking capability is less than 10 seconds away from ground asset then there may not be sufficient time to intercept and neutralize it.

**Department:** Digital Agriculture Division, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DoA&FW)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Background

India faces a growing challenge in ensuring food security while improving agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. Low productivity is often caused by traditional farming practices, inadequate access to real-time data, poor irrigation management, lack of precision in use of pesticide and/or fertilizer and delayed identification of pests and diseases. Most farmers operate on instinct and experience rather than data-driven decisions. Introducing technology that can offer customized advisory based on crop, soil and climatic conditions can significantly boost productivity and lead to use of resource efficiency, leading to better yields and higher profitability.

## Problem Description

The task is to develop a smart, data-driven advisory system that provides personalized recommendations to farmers to improve their crop productivity. This could include suggestions on optimal sowing times, irrigation scheduling, pest and disease management, fertilizer use and climate-resilient practices. The platform should be capable of gathering data from sensors (IoT), satellite imagery, weather APIs and farmer inputs. It should process the data using analytics or AI/ML techniques and present actionable guidance in a simple manner. Participants can also explore integration with Soil Health Cards data, AgriStack data, Krishi DSS data or local agricultural research station databases. The challenge lies in making the solution accessible, understandable, scalable and useful for farmers with limited digital literacy.

## Expected Solution

A prototype of a smart advisory platform (mobile app/web portal/IoT-based) that delivers timely, localized and personalized advice to farmers. It should include mechanisms for collecting field data, analysing it intelligently and delivering suggestions in local languages. Visual indicators, voice prompts or AI-powered virtual assistants can be used for ease of communication. The system must be scalable, cost-effective, energy-efficient and adaptable to different agro-climatic regions and crops. Participants are also encouraged to leverage anonymized sample data from AgriStack, India's comprehensive digital platform for the agriculture sector, to enhance the accuracy and relevance of their advisory solutions while ensuring secure and consent-based data usage. Bonus points for incorporating sustainability elements like water conservation, organic practices, or carbon footprint tracking.

**Problem ID:** 25170

**Organization:** Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

**Department:** Department of Space(DoS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Space Technology

## Background

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation. However, real-world applications often require reasoning across multiple modalities, particularly the ability to interpret and generate responses grounded in visual input. On 5th August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS (20b and 120b) open-weight models with state-of-the-art real-world performance at low cost. GPT-OSS-120B achieves near-parity with OpenAI o4-mini on core reasoning benchmarks while running efficiently on single 80GB GPU.

## Detailed Description

While GPT-OSS performs very well in text-based reasoning, it cannot process or reason over images. The challenge is to augment GPT-OSS with visual perception - a lightweight projection-based alignment between a vision encoder and the LLM, trained using open datasets. The proposed system is to demonstrate capable of image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and multimodal instruction-following, while preserving the open-source nature of the base model.

### Key challenges include

1. Aligning vision embeddings with the LLM’s text embedding space without degrading textual capabilities.
2. Sourcing high-quality multimodal datasets that are open and permissive for redistribution.
3. Achieving competitive multimodal performance within reasonable compute budgets.

## Expected Solution

The proposed/developed solutions are to address the mentioned challenges by creating a reproducible multimodal GPT-OSS model trained with publicly available datasets and an efficient training strategy. Following deliverables are expected:

1. A multimodal GPT-OSS model with vision understanding.
2. Training scripts and dataset manifests for reproducibility.
3. Benchmarks showing competitive performance against other open multimodal models.
4. A foundation for extending GPT-OSS into more advanced multimodal reasoning domains.
5. **Linkage to ISRO EO Data:** Augmentation of vision capabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs can be adapted for EO data analysis and interpretation. Such system could support highly accurate & automated Land-cover classification, change detection and environment monitoring by producing natural language explanations that cite visual evidence. Project aims to bridge the gap between Level-1 and Level-2 EO Data and decision makers/application users by enabling conversational exploration of large geospatial archives, interactive QA over time-series imagery and generation of rich, human readable reports that combine spatial analytics with domain specific reasoning.

# Problem 166: Optical-Guided Super-Resolution for Thermal IR Imagery

**Problem ID:** 25171

**Organization:** Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

**Department:** Department of Space(DoS)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Space Technology

## Background

Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing plays a vital role in urban heat island analysis, wildfire detection, and agricultural stress monitoring. However, TIR sensors typically operate at low spatial resolutions (5-10 m), limiting their ability to capture fine-scale variations in surface temperature. In contrast, optical sensors (1-5 m) capture rich spatial details such as edges, textures, and land cover boundaries but lack direct thermal information.

This mismatch creates a significant challenge: how can we generate high-resolution thermal maps that preserve accurate temperature information while capturing spatial details. A promising solution is to use fusion-based super-resolution, where optical imagery serves as a guide to enhance thermal images.

## Detailed Description

The problem requires the development of a deep learning pipeline capable of producing super-resolved thermal IR imagery by leveraging both thermal and optical data. The pipeline must address three major challenges:

1. **Multi-Sensor Alignment** - Geometrically co-registering high-resolution optical images with low-resolution TIR data.
2. **Fusion of Modalities** - Effectively combining spatial detail from optical imagery with temperature fidelity from thermal imagery without introducing artifacts.
3. **Super-Resolution of Thermal Imagery** - Up-sampling the coarse thermal data to a finer spatial resolution guided by optical details.

The generated outputs must be thermally consistent (faithful to real temperature values) and spatially sharp (preserving fine boundaries). This solution has direct applications in urban planning, wildfire management, and precision agriculture.

## Expected Solution

Participants are expected to design a fusion-based solution that may involve AI/ML methods as well as physics-based approaches to improve the accuracy and reliability of thermal super-resolution. The solution should:

1. Align optical and thermal data accurately, ensuring geometric co-registration between multi-sensor imagery.
2. Leverage optical features (edges, land cover boundaries, textures) to guide the super-resolution process.
3. Preserve thermal fidelity by maintaining physically consistent surface temperatures and avoiding transfer of false textures.
4. Incorporate physics-based priors or models (e.g., radiative transfer, emissivity correction, or energy balance principles) to strengthen the reliability of outputs, especially in regions where optical data may be misleading.
5. Generate high-resolution thermal IR maps that are both physically meaningful and suitable for real-world applications such as urban planning, wildfire monitoring, and precision agriculture.
6. Ensure the solution is computationally efficient and scalable for processing large-area satellite imagery.

## Evaluation

Solutions will be evaluated based on:

- Quantitative Metrics:

  - PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE (Kelvin) against reference thermal images.

- Qualitative Metrics:

  - Edge sharpness, alignment accuracy, and fusion realism (avoiding optical artifacts).

2. **Parsing & Normalization:** - Extract key fields (method, path, parameters, headers, payload, etc.).

   - Normalize/remove dynamic values (IDs, timestamps, tokens, etc.).

3. **Tokenization & Input Transformation:** - Convert normalized requests into token sequences suitable for a Transformer-based model.
4. **Model Training:** - Train an open-source Transformer-based model.

   - Participants are free to select transformer architecture.
   - Training can happen before the grand finale.

5. **Real-Time Inference & Live Detection:** - Deploy the trained model alongside the sample app and integrate it with Apache or Nginx.

   - The WAF component must receive each incoming request in real time and detect any anomalous request.
   - Detections must run in non-blocking mode i.e multiple requests should be scanned simultaneously, without blocking each other or delaying normal traffic.

6. **Continuous Updates:** - Provide an automated mechanism to re-train or fine-tune the existing model on new benign traffic.

   - Update should be incremental, there should not be a need to retrain the model on full data, training will be done only on incremental data.

7. **Demonstration:** - Use the supplied web application to show live detection of malicious requests.

   - Participants will inject malicious payloads (e.g., via curl or script) to test detection.
   - Judges will provide payload, requests to be done during grand finale to detect accuracy and detection ratio.

## Expected Solution

1. **Ingestion:** Batch and real-time ingestion of access logs (commonly used format by apache/nginx).
2. **Parser:** Structured extraction, normalization.
3. **Tokenizer:** Prepares request sequence for Transformer.
4. **Model Training:** Transformer model trained on benign traffic.
5. **Integration:** Model integration into Apache/Nginx pipeline (via module, sidecar, or external micro service).
6. **Non-Blocking Detection:** Concurrent inference on real world traffic.
7. **Continuous Update:** Script / API for periodic retraining on incremental data only.
8. **Demo:** Live test of malicious input triggering detection log.

**Department:** Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDI)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Automation

## Background

NaCCER, the R&D arm of CIL, plays a pivotal role in fostering research and innovation in the coal sector. It receives a large volume of research proposals from premier institutions across India, for funding by the Ministry of Coal (MoC) and Coal India Limited (CIL). The evaluation process of these proposals is rigorous, involving multiple layers of scrutiny to assess technical feasibility, financial viability, novelty, and relevance to the coal industry. Currently, the initial screening is conducted at NaCCER, followed by expert review within CIL, as per the S&T guidelines. Given the increasing number of proposals and the complexity of manual evaluation, the process is becoming time-intensive and error-prone.

## Description

At present, each R&D proposal submitted to NaCCER undergoes comprehensive manual scrutiny. This includes detailed reading, financial assessment, technical feasibility analysis by domain experts within CMPDIL/CIL, and novelty checks using manually maintained Word and Excel databases. These steps demand significant human effort, subjectivity, and time. Moreover, the approval workflow involves apex committee and R&D Board meetings for CIL funding and SSRC/TSC for MoC funding, which meet only a few times a year. Any oversight or missing information during initial scrutiny may result in the rejection of high-potential proposals, or delays due to prolonged correction cycles. These limitations highlight the need for a standardized, efficient, and intelligent evaluation mechanism.

## Expected Solution

An AI/ML-based auto-evaluation system can significantly enhance the R&D proposal review process. The system should be capable of benchmarking submitted proposals against a structured database of past and ongoing projects to assess novelty. It should also be able to perform automated financial checks in line with S&T funding guidelines. By generating an objective evaluation score for each proposal, the system will streamline selection and rejection decisions, improve consistency, eliminate manual biases, and reduce processing time. This digitized approach will not only standardize evaluations but also ensure transparency and credibility in the funding decision process.

# Problem 202: Prashiskshan - An app for Academia Industry Interface

**Problem ID:** 25207

**Organization:** Government of Jammu and Kashmir

**Department:** Directorate of Colleges, Higher Education Department

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background

The problem of skill enhancement in colleges is a major issue, especially when it comes to preparing students for the job market. In the context of the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Semester 5 for internships refers to the fifth semester of a 4-year undergraduate degree (typically under the Multidisciplinary Four-Year Undergraduate Programme). Key features of NEP include:

1. Emphasis on Experiential Learning - NEP promotes hands-on learning through internships, fieldwork, and apprenticeships. Semester 5 is typically when students have completed basic foundational and disciplinary courses, and they are ready for practical exposure to apply their knowledge in real-life settings.
2. Timing in the 4-Year Program - In a 4-year UG program:

   - Semester 1-2: Foundation courses;
   - Semester 3-4: Major-specific and interdisciplinary subjects;
   - Semester 5-6: Internships, field projects, or community engagement;
   - Semester 7-8: Research, specialization, or advanced projects. Semester 5 is when students begin industry, research, or community internships to gain practical experience.

3. Flexibility in Internships - Internships may be in industries relevant to the student's major, with NGOs, government departments, or research institutions, and can be short-term (during summer) or extended (as part of credit-based coursework).
4. Credit-Based Evaluation - Internships under NEP can be credit-bearing, i.e., they count towards the student's academic score, and students are often required to submit a report or presentation to reflect learning outcomes.
5. Career Readiness - By Semester 5, students begin career exploration, networking, and gaining experience that prepares them for final-year placements, startups or entrepreneurship, and higher education or research.

In short, "Semester 5 for internships" in NEP means students, by the 5th semester of their undergraduate program, should engage in industry or field-based internships to develop practical skills, gain exposure, and align learning with real-world needs, in line with NEP's emphasis on holistic and experiential education.

The internship system often fails in colleges-especially under the NEP model-for several critical reasons:

1. Lack of Industry Tie-ups - Limited partnerships with companies, no proper MoUs or placement cells.
2. Poor Planning and Late Implementation - Programs introduced suddenly without planning.
3. No Monitoring or Mentorship - No faculty supervision or follow-up.
4. Students Not Industry-Ready - Lack of skills discourages companies from taking interns.
5. Unavailability of Quality Internships in Rural/Remote Areas - Limited industry presence; ineffective online internships.
6. Administrative and Logistical Failures - Poor coordination, lack of funding, and unclear guidelines.
7. Fake Internships and Certificate Mills - Students buying certificates or joining non-functional organizations.

## Description

Solution for the gap is student-industry-college tie-up to develop an app for solving internship system failures, which can be a powerful and sustainable solution.

## Stakeholders & Their Roles

1. Students - Data enrolment in the app, conduct surveys to gather real internship pain points, design and develop the app.
2. College - Provide mentorship and faculty coordinator, offer academic credit for student work (as per NEP), facilitate outreach to companies and sign MoUs, host the app under the institution's digital portal.
3. Industry Partners - Share real-time internship openings, provide API access or dashboards to manage intern applications, offer short-term/remote internship slots for trial, work in hybrid mode.

**Implementation Strategy** - Stakeholder collaboration with government education departments, college faculty, NGOs, and counselors for content and outreach; technology development partner to build a scalable, lightweight app with offline features; pilot launch in select districts; full-scale rollout through government colleges and skill centers; real-time monitoring and feedback.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Streamlined Internship Process - One-stop solution to find, apply, track, and complete internships.
2. Increased Internship Participation - Easier access and transparency, especially for rural students.
3. Skill Development & Readiness - Real-world experience with pre-internship training modules.
4. Better Faculty Involvement - Dashboards to track progress and provide feedback.
5. Stronger College-Industry Connect - Regular interaction, partnerships, live projects, and events.
6. Authentic, NEP-Compliant Reports - Real-time logbooks and formatted reports to prevent fakes.
7. Data for Academic Improvement - App analytics for insights on industries, skill gaps, and performance.

## Proposed Solution

To create a centralized, digital platform that simplifies and strengthens the internship process, ensures NEP compliance, enhances skill development, and fosters real-time collaboration between students, faculty, and industry. App will work under the following modules:

1. Student-Centered Internship Portal
2. Industry Collaboration Module

They are susceptible to Signal Interference by jamming, multipath interference & atmospheric conditions and Signal Attenuation by obstacle & weather conditions, impacting the signal strength and accuracy of PNT services. Additionally, the availability of PNT signals is limited due to satellite geometry, satellite health and local terrain conditions. Therefore, the reliability of traditional systems is affected by denial by spoofing, degradation by jamming by natural or artificial threats. Review of the emerging technologies in PNT indicates potential use of alternative PNT solutions leveraging the space assets in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which broadly includes dedicated satellite constellations with PNT signals, Signals of Opportunity and integrated or fused Communication & PNT systems. However, the proliferation and the availability of signals of various mega constellations (such as Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, Iridium, Guo Wang. NOAA, etc), accelerated the advances in the research and implementation of Cognitive Opportunistic Navigation technologies.

## Description

Signals of opportunity refers to use of Radio frequency (RF) signals from the satellites which are not designed for PNT service. This concept often involves measurement of Doppler shift, pseudo-range and/or carrier phase to compute the user's position. These signals can be of any origin including communication satellites and other non-PNT satellites. The advancements in opportunistic navigation using LEO satellites has shown promising results. However, they are in research phase and not yet mature enough for industrial or commercial deployment. The major challenges include unstable clocks, satellite orbit errors, unknown signal structures and associated ground infrastructure, with limited support from the commercial and traditional market players. Therefore, there is a need to develop a Cognitive Opportunistic LEO-PNT receiver system, capable of utilising signals of opportunity to meet sub-metric accuracy of PNT services.

## Expected Solution

A cognitive opportunistic LEO-PNT receiver system to be designed developed and manufactured with suitable compensation of errors originating from frequency estimation, satellite orbit, clock and atmospheric effects for accurate and computationally efficient PNT Solution. The system is expected to be handheld form factor with the ability to provide services for continuous operation for 24 hours. The receiver should be optimised with cognitive capabilities for enhanced positional accuracy, frequency agnostic and robust in performance.

These attacks often using advanced techniques, remain undetected and maintaining persistence for extended periods, and can involve a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These developed Threat rules in ELK can be used for detection of various malicious activities related to APTs.

## Description

The above problem statement envisages, that a detection of APTs by development of Threat rules in ELK. Detecting APTs typically involves monitoring large amounts of data, which requires a robust, scalable solution for real-time analysis of logs, network traffic, and system events. By analysing logs from different sources (e.g., endpoints, network devices, servers), an organization can gain insights into suspicious activities that may indicate an APT attack. Developing and fine-tuning detection rules are mandatory in ELK Stack to identify the various stages of an APT attack lifecycle and detection of various activities such as credential dumping, Internal Reconnaissance, lateral movement, PowerShell execution, unusual egress data etc. The project should use an APT sample (available with known public repositories) to generate realistic log data, which will then be ingested and processed by the ELK Stack.

## Expected Solution

The threat rules to be developed for detection of APT attacks, APT attack lifecycle, stages of an APT attack lifecycle with suitable APT Sample in ELK.

# Problem 234: AI/ML-Based Identification of Cryptographic Primitives and Protocols in Multi-Architecture Firmware Binaries

**Problem ID:** 25239

**Organization:** National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)

**Department:** National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO)

**Category:** Software

**Theme:** Blockchain & Cybersecurity

## Background

The rapid proliferation of embedded systems in IoT, automotive, industrial, and consumer devices has led to increased use of cryptographic mechanisms to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. However, the widespread deployment of proprietary or undocumented firmware often obscures the presence and nature of cryptographic functions, especially when symbol information is stripped or the implementation is obfuscated.

Traditional static and dynamic analysis techniques are limited in scale, manual in nature, and architecture-specific. With the diversity of instruction sets (ARM, z80, AVR, MIPS, RISC-V, etc.), and the usage of both standard and proprietary cryptographic algorithms, there is a growing need for intelligent tools that can automatically detect, classify, and analyze cryptographic routines and protocols embedded in firmware binaries.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly in code embeddings, function similarity, and graph-based learning, offer promising solutions for automating cryptographic function identification and functionality inference at scale.

## Description

The above problem statement aims to develop a unified AI/ML-based framework to automatically identify and interpret cryptographic primitives and protocol implementations in firmware binaries of heterogeneous architectures, including scenarios where the firmware is a black-box (i.e., no source code or symbols are available).

The approach to the solution may begin with the controlled creation and compilation of crypto and non-crypto binaries for multiple instruction set architectures (ISAs) using standard crypto libraries. An annotated binary dataset may first be created, appropriate features to be extracted and further the dataset created along with features can be used for training and validation to build models that can detect crypto routines, distinguish standard vs proprietary algorithms, identify crypto protocol structure (e.g., handshake, key exchange) and infer high-level functionality (e.g., encryption, authentication, signing). Further the model can be extended to work on black-box firmware images extracted from real devices.

## Expected Solution

A portable and modular AI/ML-based system for cryptographic primitives in firmware. The models should be capable of identifying known and potentially proprietary crypto implementations and should classify types of crypto (AES, RSA, ECC, SHA, XOR, PRNG, etc.). It should detect cryptographic protocol patterns and states. The model should provide insights into crypto protocol behaviours in black-box firmware. The model should be evaluated for its detection accuracy, precision, recall, and false positives.
